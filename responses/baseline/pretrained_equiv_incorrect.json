Express $x$ as a common fraction.\nAlright, let's break this down step by step so it's easy to understand.\n\n1. We have an equation: $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n2. The ceiling function, $\\lceil x \\rceil$, means we round $x$ up to the nearest whole number.\n3. We need to find a value for $x$ that makes this equation true.\n\nLet's think about what $\\dfrac{23}{7}$ is. When we divide 23 by 7, we get a number that is a little more than 3 but less than 4. So, $\\dfrac{23}{7}$ is between 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for $\\lceil x \\rceil$:\n- If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$, then $x$ must be between 3 and 4 (not including 3).\n- If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$, then $x$ must be between 4 and 5 (not including 4).\n\nWe need to check which of these possibilities makes the equation true.\n\n1. If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$, then $x$ is between 3 and 4. Let's say $x = 3 + a$, where $0 < a < 1$.\n   - The equation becomes $3 + (3 + a) = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Simplifying, we get $6 + a = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get $a = \\dfrac{23}{7} - 6 = \\dfrac{23}{7} - \\dfrac{42}{7} = \\dfrac{23 - 42}{7} = \\dfrac{-19}{7}$, which is not possible since $a$ must be positive.\n\n2. If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$, then $x$ is between 4 and 5. Let's say $x = 4 + b$, where $0 < b < 1$.\n   - The equation becomes $4 + (4 + b) = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Simplifying, we get $8 + b = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get $b = \\dfrac{23}{7} - 8 = \\dfrac{23}{7} - \\dfrac{56}{7} = \\dfrac{23 - 56}{7} = \\dfrac{-33}{7}$, which is also not possible since $b$ must be positive.\n\nSince neither case works, let's re-evaluate our approach. We need to find a value for $x$ that fits the equation exactly.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n- We know $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n- Let $x = n + f$, where $n$ is an integer and $0",

We know that in a right triangle, the sum of the angles is 90 degrees. Since angle \\( B \\) is given as 90 degrees, we can find angle \\( C \\) by subtracting angle \\( B \\) from 90 degrees.\n\n2. We are given that \\( \\cos{B} = \\frac{3}{5} \\). Since \\( B \\) is 90 degrees, we know that \\( \\cos{90^\\circ} = 0 \\). But we need to find \\( \\cos{C} \\).\n\n3. In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the lengths of the sides of the triangle.\n\n4. We know that the hypotenuse \\( AC \\) is 9 units long. Let's denote the lengths of the other two sides as \\( AB \\) and \\( BC \\).\n\n5. Using the Pythagorean theorem:\n   \\[\n   AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AB^2 + BC^2 = 9^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   AB^2 + BC^2 = 81\n   \\]\n\n6. We also know that \\( \\cos{B} = \\frac{3}{5} \\). This means that the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse for angle \\( B \\) is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\). Since \\( B \\) is 90 degrees, we can use this ratio to find the lengths of the sides.\n\n7. Let's assume \\( AB = 3k \\) and \\( BC = 4k \\) for some constant \\( k \\). Then:\n   \\[\n   (3k)^2 + (4k)^2 = 81\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9k^2 + 16k^2 = 81\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   25k^2 = 81\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k^2 = \\frac{81}{25}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   k = \\frac{9}{5}\n   \\]\n\n8. Now we can find the lengths of \\( AB \\) and \\( BC \\):\n   \\[\n   AB = 3k = 3 \\times \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{27}{5}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   BC = 4k = 4 \\times \\frac{9}{5} = \\frac{36}{5}\n   \\]\n\n9. Now we can find \\( \\cos{C} \\). Since \\( C \\) is the angle opposite side \\( AB \\), we have:\n   \\[\n   \\cos{C} = \\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{\\frac{36}{5}}{9} = \\frac{36}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{36}{45} =",

This means it's an isosceles triangle with two equal sides.\n2. $AD$ is an altitude, which means it goes from vertex $A$ to the midpoint of $BC$, making it perpendicular to $BC$.\n3. $E$ is a point on $AC$ such that $AB \\parallel DE$. This means $DE$ is parallel to $AB$.\n4.

    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "degrees.\nAlright, let's break this down step by step so it's easy to understand.\n\n1. **Understanding Vectors**: Imagine you have two arrows pointing in space. These arrows are called vectors. In this problem, we have two vectors:\n   - Vector A: $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - Vector B: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -7 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2. **Dot Product**: To find the angle between these two vectors, we first need to calculate something called the dot product. The dot product of two vectors is a way to multiply them together to get a single number. For vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix}$, the dot product is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   a_1 \\cdot b_1 + a_2 \\cdot b_2 + a_3 \\cdot b_3\n   \\]\n   So, for our vectors:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 0 + (-3) \\cdot (-7) + (-4) \\cdot (-1) = 0 + 21 + 4 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Magnitude of Vectors**: Next, we need to find the magnitudes (lengths) of each vector. The magnitude of a vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}\n   \\]\n   For Vector A:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5^2 + (-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 9 + 16} = \\sqrt{50}\n   \\]\n   For Vector B:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{0^2 + (-7)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 49 + 1} = \\sqrt{50}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cosine of the Angle**: Now, we use the dot product and the magnitudes to find the cosine of the angle between the vectors. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{dot product}}{\\text{magnitude of A} \\times \\text{magnitude of B}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{50} \\times \\sqrt{50}} = \\frac{25}{50} = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Angle**: Finally, we use the inverse cosine (arccos) to find the angle in degrees:\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\arccos(0.5)\n   \\]\n   The angle",
