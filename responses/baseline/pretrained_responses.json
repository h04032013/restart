We have a quadratic equation: \\(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\\).\n2. We need to find the solutions (roots) of this equation. These solutions are the values of \\(x\\) that make the equation true.\n3. Once we have the solutions, we will square each of them (multiply each solution by itself).\n4. Finally, we will find the product of these squared solutions.\n\nLet's start by finding the solutions of the quadratic equation. We can use the quadratic formula, which is:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n\nFor our equation \\(2x^2 + 13x + 6 = 0\\), the coefficients are:\n- \\(a = 2\\)\n- \\(b = 13\\)\n- \\(c = 6\\)\n\nPlugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:\n\n\\[ x = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{13^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 6}}{2 \\cdot 2} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{169 - 48}}{4} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-13 \\pm \\sqrt{121}}{4} \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{-13 \\pm 11}{4} \\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[ x_1 = \\frac{-13 + 11}{4} = \\frac{-2}{4} = -\\frac{1}{2} \\]\n\\[ x_2 = \\frac{-13 - 11}{4} = \\frac{-24}{4} = -6 \\]\n\nNow, we square each solution:\n\\[ (-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\\[ (-6)^2 = 36 \\]\n\nFinally, we find the product of these squared solutions:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{4} \\times 36 = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the product of the squares of the solutions is \\(9\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}\n\\]",

Express $x$ as a common fraction.\nAlright, let's break this down step by step so it's easy to understand.\n\n1. We have an equation: $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n2. The ceiling function, $\\lceil x \\rceil$, means we round $x$ up to the nearest whole number.\n3. We need to find a value for $x$ that makes this equation true.\n\nLet's think about what $\\dfrac{23}{7}$ is. When we divide 23 by 7, we get a number that is a little more than 3 but less than 4. So, $\\dfrac{23}{7}$ is between 3 and 4.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values for $\\lceil x \\rceil$:\n- If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$, then $x$ must be between 3 and 4 (not including 3).\n- If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$, then $x$ must be between 4 and 5 (not including 4).\n\nWe need to check which of these possibilities makes the equation true.\n\n1. If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 3$, then $x$ is between 3 and 4. Let's say $x = 3 + a$, where $0 < a < 1$.\n   - The equation becomes $3 + (3 + a) = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Simplifying, we get $6 + a = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get $a = \\dfrac{23}{7} - 6 = \\dfrac{23}{7} - \\dfrac{42}{7} = \\dfrac{23 - 42}{7} = \\dfrac{-19}{7}$, which is not possible since $a$ must be positive.\n\n2. If $\\lceil x \\rceil = 4$, then $x$ is between 4 and 5. Let's say $x = 4 + b$, where $0 < b < 1$.\n   - The equation becomes $4 + (4 + b) = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Simplifying, we get $8 + b = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n   - Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get $b = \\dfrac{23}{7} - 8 = \\dfrac{23}{7} - \\dfrac{56}{7} = \\dfrac{23 - 56}{7} = \\dfrac{-33}{7}$, which is also not possible since $b$ must be positive.\n\nSince neither case works, let's re-evaluate our approach. We need to find a value for $x$ that fits the equation exactly.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n- We know $\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$.\n- Let $x = n + f$, where $n$ is an integer and $0",

This means that if you input a number and its opposite (like 2 and -2), the output will be the same.\n\n- An **odd function** is one that satisfies the condition \\( f(-x) = -f(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) in the domain of the function. This means that if you input a number and its opposite, the output will be the negative of the original output.\n\nNow, let's look at the function \\( f(x) = 3^x \\).\n\n1. Check if it's even:\n   - Calculate \\( f(-x) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(-x) = 3^{-x}\n     \\]\n   - Compare \\( f(-x) \\) with \\( f(x) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(x) = 3^x\n     \\]\n   - Clearly, \\( 3^{-x} \\) is not equal to \\( 3^x \\) for all \\( x \\). So, \\( f(x) \\) is not an even function.\n\n2. Check if it's odd:\n   - Calculate \\( -f(x) \\):\n     \\[\n     -f(x) = -3^x\n     \\]\n   - Compare \\( f(-x) \\) with \\( -f(x) \\):\n     \\[\n     f(-x) = 3^{-x}\n     \\]\n   - Clearly, \\( 3^{-x} \\) is not equal to \\( -3^x \\) for all \\( x \\).

For example, \\( f(1) = 3 \\), \\( f(2) = 9 \\), and \\( f(3) = 27 \\).\n   - As \\( x \\) decreases, \\( f(x) \\) approaches 0 but never actually reaches it.

Also, make sure the final answer is clearly boxed as requested. \\boxed{\\text{Your answer here}} \n\n#### Problem: Find the modulo 4 residue of $17 \\cdot 18$.\n\n#### Solution:\nOkay, let's dive into this problem step by step, making it super easy to understand, just like we're explaining it to a 5th grader.\n\nFirst, we have two numbers, 17 and 18. We need to find out what happens when we multiply these two numbers together. So, let's do that:\n\n\\[ 17 \\times 18 = 306 \\]\n\nNow, we have a new number, 306, but we're not done yet. We have a special question: \"What happens when we divide 306 by 4?\" We're looking for the remainder, which is the number left over after dividing.\n\nTo find this, we can do a little math. When we divide 306 by 4, we get 76 with something left over. To find out what that something is, we can do a quick division:\n\n\\[ 306 \\div 4 = 76 \\text{ with a remainder of } 2 \\]\n\nThis means that when we divide 306 by 4, we get 76 whole times, and then we're left with 2. This 2 is what we're interested in because it's the remainder, and it's also called the modulo 4 residue. It's like asking, \"After dividing 306 by 4, what number do I have left?\"\n\nSo, the modulo 4 residue of 306 (which is the same as the modulo 4 residue of $17 \\times 18$) is 2. This is a cool way to see how numbers can be broken down and understood in different ways.\n\nAnd now, for the final part of our task, let's put our answer in a special box, just like a treasure chest for our answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\nAnd there you have it!

    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "degrees.\nAlright, let's break this down step by step so it's easy to understand.\n\n1. **Understanding Vectors**: Imagine you have two arrows pointing in space. These arrows are called vectors. In this problem, we have two vectors:\n   - Vector A: $\\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ -3 \\\\ -4 \\end{pmatrix}$\n   - Vector B: $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -7 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n2. **Dot Product**: To find the angle between these two vectors, we first need to calculate something called the dot product. The dot product of two vectors is a way to multiply them together to get a single number. For vectors $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix}$, the dot product is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   a_1 \\cdot b_1 + a_2 \\cdot b_2 + a_3 \\cdot b_3\n   \\]\n   So, for our vectors:\n   \\[\n   5 \\cdot 0 + (-3) \\cdot (-7) + (-4) \\cdot (-1) = 0 + 21 + 4 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Magnitude of Vectors**: Next, we need to find the magnitudes (lengths) of each vector. The magnitude of a vector $\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + a_3^2}\n   \\]\n   For Vector A:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{5^2 + (-3)^2 + (-4)^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 9 + 16} = \\sqrt{50}\n   \\]\n   For Vector B:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{0^2 + (-7)^2 + (-1)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 49 + 1} = \\sqrt{50}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Cosine of the Angle**: Now, we use the dot product and the magnitudes to find the cosine of the angle between the vectors. The formula is:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{dot product}}{\\text{magnitude of A} \\times \\text{magnitude of B}}\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values we found:\n   \\[\n   \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{25}{\\sqrt{50} \\times \\sqrt{50}} = \\frac{25}{50} = 0.5\n   \\]\n\n5. **Finding the Angle**: Finally, we use the inverse cosine (arccos) to find the angle in degrees:\n   \\[\n   \\theta = \\arccos(0.5)\n   \\]\n   The angle",
